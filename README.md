This is the official repository for anonymous submission for ICLR2025 named **Brain Bandit: A Biologically Grounded Neural Network for Efficient Control of Exploration**

The MDP part is built on the work from Ian Osband https://github.com/iosband/TabulaRL

The mice behavior part is built on the work from https://github.com/celiaberon/2ABT_behavior_models

We would like to express our sincere thanks for them and for other works that inspired our research.Â
